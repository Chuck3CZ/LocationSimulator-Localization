# Localization

These are the official localization files for LocationSimulator. Feel free to fork the project and contribute to an existing language or create a new one. The easiest why to edit these files is by using [LocalizationEditor](https://github.com/igorkulman/iOSLocalizationEditor). Just click on the release link on the right sidebar and download the latest release. To contribute a new language follow these steps: 

1. Download or clone this repository. 
2. Create a new folder with your language code and the file ending `lproj`. 
3. Place a new empty file called `Localizable.strings` inside the newly created folder.
4. Start `LocalizationEditor` and click on the folder icon.
5. Choose the downloaded `Localization` folder.
6. You'll get a list will all strings to localize. Missing strings are highlighted with a red border.
7. Open a pull request or open a new issue and upload your strings.

If you want to edit an existing language just skip step 2 and 3.
